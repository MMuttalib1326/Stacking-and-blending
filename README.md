# Stacking-and-blending
What is stacking and blending? Most commonly, blending is used to describe the specific application of stacking where the meta-model is trained on the predictions made by base-models on a hold-out validation dataset. In this context, stacking is reserved for a meta-model that is trained on out-of fold predictions during a cross-validation procedure.
